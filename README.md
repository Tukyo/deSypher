# deSypher: A DApp Where You Guess Words or Go Broke

The goal of the game is to guess the correct word within 4 tries. You are only able to guess words that are on the word list, meaning you can never guess a word that could not be the correct word.

To play deSypher, you need to hold $SYPHER tokens. These tokens will be used to grant you access to the puzzle, and you will be rewarded with $SYPHER if you win.

## Rules

### Win:
- **First Try**: Guessing the correct word on the first try rewards the player with the SYPHER CACHE. This is a pool of $SYPHER tokens that continually increases as players lose.
- **Second or Third Try**: Guessing correctly on the second or third try yields significant rewards. The second attempt gives the maximum reward, while the third attempt gives the minimum reward.
- **Fourth Try**: If you haven't succeeded in three tries, the fourth try gives you a chance to win back the amount you paid to play.

### Lose:
If you fail to guess the correct word within 4 tries, the following happens with the $SYPHER tokens:
- **2.5%** go to the SYPHER CACHE.
- **2.5%** are directed to liquidity pooling functionality.
- **5%** remain in the rewards pool, effectively leaving circulation until another player wins.
