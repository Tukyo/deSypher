# deSypher: A DApp Where You Guess Words or Go Broke

## TL;DR

The goal of the game is to guess the correct word within 4 tries. You are only able to guess words that are on the word list, meaning you can never guess a word that could not be the correct word.

To play deSypher, you need to hold $SYPHER tokens. These tokens will be used to grant you access to the puzzle, and you will be rewarded with $SYPHER if you win.

### Contracts
[SYPHER](https://basescan.org/token/0x21b9d428eb20fa075a29d51813e57bab85406620) • [deSypher]() • [Game Manager]() • [MasterSypher]()

## Rules

### Win:
- **First Try**: Guessing the correct word on the first try rewards the player with the SYPHER CACHE. This is a pool of $SYPHER tokens that continually increases as players lose.
- **Second or Third Try**: Guessing correctly on the second or third try yields significant rewards. The second attempt gives the maximum reward, while the third attempt gives the minimum reward.
- **Fourth Try**: If you haven't succeeded in three tries, the fourth try gives you a chance to win back the amount you paid to play.

### Lose:
If you fail to guess the correct word within 4 tries, the following happens with the $SYPHER tokens:
- **1%** goes to the Master Sypher.
- **24%** is directed to liquidity pooling functionality.
- **25%** enters the SYPHER CACHE.
- **50%** remain in the rewards pool, effectively leaving circulation until another player wins.

## Extras
### Master Sypher
The Master Sypher is the #1 player in the game. They receive 1% of all player losses while holding the MSPHR token.
